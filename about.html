<p>This site serves as a landing page of sorts for two places marginally more interesting.</p>
<p><b><a href="www.itwritsmall.com">IT Writ Small</a></b> is my professional web site.  It focuses on Systems Operations for small business, specifically: monitoring, alerting, network discovery, security assessment, documentation and automated deployment.  And some other odds and ends.</p>
<p><b><a href="www.effectiveflybox.com">The Effective Fly Box</a></b></b> is my website focusing on fly tying.  It's about tying a box full of flies that you can fish for trout pretty much anywhere.</p>
<p>Anything that doesn't fit on either of those two web sites stays here, in the <b></b><a href="http://www.monigold.com/posts">Posts</a></b> section.</p>
